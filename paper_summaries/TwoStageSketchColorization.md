# Two-stage Sketch Colorization
## Summary
By using a 2-step approach, Zhang et al. perform colorization of manga images. The first step takes grayscale sketches and user hints as input to an encoder-decoder network, and outputs a color draft. This output is fed through a GAN-style discriminator. The loss is comprised by a GAN loss, an L1 reconstruction loss, and a “positive regularization loss”, which encourages a large color variance. The second step takes grayscale sketches and user hints as input to a encoder-decoder network. It also takes a color draft as input to an Inception V1, whose output is concatenated at the bottleneck of the encoder-decoder. The output of this step is the final painting, which is in turn fed to GAN-style discriminator. The loss here in the GAN-loss, and an L1 reconstruction loss. The training drafts are obtained by adding distortions to ground truth paintings.
